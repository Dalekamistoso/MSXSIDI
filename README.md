# DrWh0's OneChipMSX unofficial port for [Sidi Board]

Ported from:

https://github.com/mist-devel/mist-board/wiki

https://github.com/mist-devel/MSX_MiST/tree/master (Mist Core main repository)

This is my own functional port of the latest MSX core for Sidi FPGA ported from the Mist core.

It features:

* The lastest source updates in the last two years
* UART support (Wifi+Midi....)

Use at your own risk

Enjoy it!

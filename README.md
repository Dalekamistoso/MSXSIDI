# MSXSIDI
OCM/MSX Sidi core port, Initial attempt 

This is my own first functional port of the latest MSX core for Sidi FPGA ported from the Mist core, is made for my personal use but since it features the lastest changes in the last two years and also features UART support (Wifi+Midi....) I decided to share it

This is in an early WIP state and needs refactoring renaming and some cleanup/changes but it seems fully functional, use at your own risk

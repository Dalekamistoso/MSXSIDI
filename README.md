# MSXSIDI
OCM/MSX Sidi core port, Initial attempt 

This is my own first functional port of the latest MSX core for Sidi FPGA ported from the Mist core, it features the lastest changes in the last two years and also features UART support (Wifi+Midi....)

Is in a WIP state and needs refactoring and some cleanup/changes but it seems fully functional, use at your own risk

# DrWh0's OneChipMSX unofficial port for [Sidi Board]

Ported from:
https://github.com/mist-devel/mist-board/wiki
https://github.com/mist-devel/MSX_MiST/tree/master (Mist Core main repository)

This is my own functional port of the latest MSX core for Sidi FPGA ported from the Mist core.

It was made for my personal use but since it features the lastest changes in the last two years and also features UART support (Wifi+Midi....) I decided to share it

Enjoy!
